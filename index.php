            <p class="secSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>

            <p class="secSubTag text-small">Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool
                or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.There
                are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education towards
                applicable relevance in the students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at
                large or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by some
                governments and the United Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development
                Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all. In most regions, education is compulsory up to a
                certain age.</p>

            <p class="secSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge
                and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and
                through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next.
                As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through
                imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.Matteo
                Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607Plato
                founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[3] The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European
                civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.</p>
